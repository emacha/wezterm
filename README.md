# WezTerm

Local config related to WezTerm, so I can have the same terminal experience across all my machines.

To install, just clone this from ~/.config

## Just some notes

For now I'm assuming wezterm has been installed as an application.
Currently with `brew install --cask wezterm`, then need to go to config and say yeah I want to open this.

Need to manually click:

Options -> Assign to all desktops

## HammerSpoon

Yeah it's bad but I'll keep the hammerspoon config here too.
Just dump the config in `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` and it should work.
